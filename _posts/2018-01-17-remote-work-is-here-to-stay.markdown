Last year, a Wall Street Journal article* covered the topic of remote work in a rather pragmatic approach. Christopher Mims covered the topic with both journalistic intrigue and presented facts from both sides of the remote work camps. Obviously, I am on the pro-remote side, but it was interesting to hear about how some companies are actually in a draw-back from some progressive remote work policies.

Mims noted that though International Business Machines (IBM) was a pioneer in the remote working space, it is now calling all of its nomadic workforce home. While this is a huge change for a company that once boasted over 40% of its employees having some type of remote work experience, it shows a sign of how the ebbs and flows of management and business strategy can the acceptance of remote work.  It is also a good example of how long-time remote work arrangements are still temporary and can be withdrawn without much recourse for the employee.

Also in the article, Mims noted that other companies are embracing the modern workforce’s desire to be unconfined by office life. Some companies are encouraging remote work to save on the operating costs of office space and expensive travel, with Automattic (the makers of Wordpress) getting rid of their sheik flagship office in San Francisco.

Now what does this mean for you? First, if you are working at a technology company, you probably already have some type of remote work option. With the advances in internet speed, communication software, cloud-based file collaboration, and more, it is easier than ever to get things done outside of the office. Most remote workers even argue that they get more done at home, free from the water-cooler gossip, time-wasting status meetings, and “drive-by” questions and favors that don’t get you closer to the business objectives.

While IBM is making the drastic move to bring its employees back into the office, many companies are looking to allow more flexibility. As the competition for valuable knowledge workers grows, companies are willing to be flexible to retain the best talent. As a (part-time) remote worker myself, I can attest to the fact the flexibility of remote working has both positive effects on my professional output and personal lives.

I’d love to hear what you think about which way you think remote work may go in the future.
