A fear of many remote workers is that others in the office will resent you for creating your own remote work possibility. Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of people who will support you and try to make you and the rest of the team successful.  

Even though you are working just as hard (if not harder) than those working from the office every day, there are those that will think you have received something that you have not earned and should not be given. These people are the “haters” I refer to in the title. 

Veteran remote workers have many experiences dealing with people who are jealous of the remote possibilities that they experiencing. Comments like, “it must be nice to sleep in and work in pajamas,” or “I wish my boss liked me as much as yours likes you,” will always come from the people who have not had the opportunity to seize their own work-life happiness.

Remote workers should never feel bad that they have a great benefit (that they have worked hard to achieve) or that others don’t have the same arrangement as them. Below are a couple strategies to help you deal with these people and give yourself credit where you deserve it. 

## Actively engage the naysayer
Instead of brushing the comments aside, ask the hater what they mean by the comment. Many people will back down when directly engaged about their unproductive comments. Those that don’t may clarify what they truly meant, which will give you the opportunity to engage them in a productive dialogue and turn them into a work ally.

A simple, “what do you mean when you say ‘it must be nice to watch tv all day while working?’” will either make the “hater” back down or clarify their own misconceptions or fears with your remote work arrangement.
-	If they give you an anecdote about knowing someone who does that and doesn’t take their job seriously, reassure them with the details of your remote work routine. Tell them about your separate home office, co-working space membership, continuing the same morning routine as in-office days, or that you use the time not spent on commuting to catch up on work that would not normally get done. 
-	If they back down, engage them with saying something like, “I was afraid of people thinking that I wasn’t going to work as hard when I am not in the office. I actually keep the same routine for in-office days as the remote ones.” This comment will reassure the hater and also open up the dialogue between you two. It also reveals some of your own vulnerabilities. This person could be a potential ally if they show interest in talking to you about your remote work experience.

## Give yourself credit
We often sell ourselves short when it comes to the positive impact our work can have on our organizations. Where you aren’t in the office every day, this issue can be amplified. Especially when others in the office think that you aren’t contributing just because they don’t see you, this can get even worse in our own heads.
-	Take stock in what you are doing and conduct an honest assessment of your work. If you are putting in the effort and can’t move the needle on your projects, that’s ok as long as you are trying your best. Figure out what is missing and add it to your work or routine. Engage others to fill in the gaps. If you are making positive strides, give yourself credit and advocate for yourself when you communicate with others.
-	When you are performing well, reach out to those in adjacent roles and offer to assist with some of your lessons learned. Many people in the office think the remote workers are only looking out for themselves.  This collaboration is another chance for you to gain an ally in the workplace.

Being a part of the “remote movement” is tough. Learning how to deal with the resistors will make your work climate much better, even if you aren’t in the office to reap the complete benefits. But then again, you are reaping some great benefits by being remote.
