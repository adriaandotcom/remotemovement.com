Just like everything else, remote work comes in all shapes and sizes and both companies and their workers are reaping the rewards. In a recent Forbes article, Anna Johansson lays out eight key characteristics that the most successful remote workers embody.

They are:
1. Self-motivated
2. Disciplined
3. Strong in communication skills
4. Already experienced in working remotely
5. Highly responsive
6. Tech-savvy

Johansson beefs up each attribute with explanation about how each will increase a remote worker’s ability to get the job done. She notes the ability of the employer to offer remote work to the best employees is a function of the employee’s ability to work well outside of the office.

I do agree that remote work is not for everyone, but there are a couple attributes that can add to the work Anna has already completed. Her previous list of items is not all encompassing and I think three big characteristics can be added to this list. For employers, these are skills that can be identified as currently existing in employees or nurtured to allow employees to grow into remote work success.

Successful remote workers must be:

1. Able to prioritize work
2. Assertive
3. Inquisitive and ask questions

Able to prioritize work: Remote work means that employees will not be under the ever-watching eye of a supervisor. With constant flow of digital communications, tasks and assignments will come in throughout the day. The most successful remote workers are able to rank and re-rank tasks in order to make sure the most important tasks get done. I always say, “put the first things first.”

Assertive: employers need to know that their remote workforce will follow the guidance, “if you see something, say something.” Remote workers are often given a list of task and told to make it happen.  There may often be times where information is missing or the right tools are not in place. An assertive employee will raise a flag and draw

Inquisitive and ask questions: many tasks for knowledge workers are passed down with incomplete or vague requirements. Though it may be difficult to speak up, the end result may be incomplete work and that your manager will ask why you didn’t speak up about. An inquisitive nature will help to understand the bigger picture and help to fully understand the project’s requirements and what the ultimate product should be.
