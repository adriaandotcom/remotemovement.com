It is a phrase that you hear a lot. Most of the time, it is when people are commiserating about something with irony. It is a great complaint to have, considering all of the alternatives possible in the world, but for a particular situation, it is something that just is less than ideal. Not being required to come into the office everyday work is one of those situations that most people would give up a lot to have. Even so, you need to acknowledge that there are issues, “struggles” if you will, when you work remotely that you’ll have to identify and overcome in order to have a better situation for yourself. 

## Morning struggles
It can be difficult to get yourself up in the morning when you know you don’t have to look your best for the office and there is not going to be a commute to start off your day. Logic says that you can roll out of bed at 8:55 and be “at work” by 9.  However, this will not lead to productive work as your whole life has conditioned you to have a morning routine or to get your mind and body ready to be productive.  Here are a couple of ideas to help your mornings:
-	If you have a partner with a similar workday, get up at the same time as they do. This way, you are not interrupting their rest and can share a part of the day before settling in for the “grind.”
-	Get dressed. You don’t have to put on a suit and tie but you should at least get out of the pajamas. Your mind will take the act of putting on new clothes as a sign it is time to get to work. Plus, you may want to go work outside of the home and you will have to stop working in order to make yourself presentable.  
-	Spend the first 5 minutes “logged in” coming up with your task list for the day. Without a boss looking over your shoulder, this will help you stay productive, especially in the post-lunch doldrums.

## Afternoon struggles
If the sun is shining and you aren’t caged in by an office, it can be difficult to stay “logged in,” both mentally and figuratively. Your circadian rhythm is probably going to bring you to a low and the eyelids may get heavy. Depending on how you work remotely, this can be the most difficult times of the day. If you work from home and have kids, this may also be when they come home from school.  Here are a couple tips to push through to “quitting time”:
-	Get up and go for a walk. If you are in your home working, this will get you out and about. Walks are good for your health and help to remind you that there are other people in the world. Even if you work from coffee shops or a coworking space, walking gets the blood flowing and gives you an opportunity to completely unplug, at least for a few minutes. Think of this walk as your office chit-chat time, so don’t go too long and not be “present” for work.
-	Have a healthy snack to keep the blood sugar level normal.  You don’t want to hit the afternoon low and be hungry at the same time. Have a healthy option on standby so that you don’t gorge yourself on candy and chips. The act of eating often helps our brain kick back into productivity. 

## End of the day struggles
Many remote workers have trouble “signing off” at the end of the day. Because you have no commute, it may be easier to keep working until the time you would get home if you did have to drive. Due to the ease of working remote, it can be very easy to give your employer an extra couple of hours at the end of the day. You also won’t have that bustling of coworkers packing up near you, something that will definitely trigger your mental timeclock “punch out.”
-	Set an end time and try to stick to it. Yes, there are times when working a little while longer to finish a task makes sense, but don’t make this a habit. Your remote work agreement didn’t include you working extra time, every day and if you do it consistently, it will become an expectation that would not be there if you were in the office.
-	“complete” your day by creating a list of things to do tomorrow. We can work the “extra” time because we think there is so much to do, so acknowledge this issue by taking note of what is still left. If you work on a team, send an email to the team members about what you were able to accomplish today and what will need to get done tomorrow.

## Relationship struggles
Friends and family may de-value your work because of the fact you are given the flexibility by your workplace to get your work down without the “over-the-shoulder” supervision that is commonplace. You may get asked to run errands for people or have kids at home with you for several hours after school ends. Identifying the issues is the first step in addressing them. You don’t want to resent your remote work agreement because now you are working a full day, plus squeezing in more chores, errands, and favors that would not be expected of you if you were in the office.
-	Limit errands and chores during the workday.  An errand here and there can quickly snowball into hours away from your computer, not to mention the mental cost of switching between tasks. Stay focused on your work when you should be working and set boundaries for yourself to keep you honest.
-	Set boundaries with your friends and family. Others may not understand that even though you are not in an office, you are actually working. Every once in a while is understandable, but if you set a solid limit in the beginning, it will be easier for others to know that their innocent requests are actually hurting your productivity.

The easiest way to fight through the struggle is acknowledging that you have a different life now that you are not in the office every day. Remote working requires more self-control and discipline, but the trade-offs are worth it.  The ability to work from anywhere is a gift, and you should remember to honor and respect it like one.

Being a part of the “remote movement” is tough but with the right tools and mindset, you can be even more successful and have a better life than the one you had while in the office full time.
