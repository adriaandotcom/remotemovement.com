	<h2>Why the remote movement?</h2>
</header>

Because we found quite some hurdles with starting to work remotely and got so much information on how to do this, we thought, why not share this with other people and help them work remote.

Michael started to work remote after a couple trial runs while he and his wife worked in different cities. His manager became a huge advocate for him and the two of them worked together to create a remote work agreement that was entirely unique within their large company. Adriaan took the leap and went for a full remote work arrangement, which his job was against. He found a different employer, one that would allow him to work remotely and his original job called him back for help. He worked out a remote work arrangement with his original employer, travelling the world as a digital nomad while still keeping a standard programming job with a traditional company.

Both of us found remote work happiness by knowing what we wanted, creating allies in the workplaces, and asking for the lifestyle that would both work for our company and our own overall happiness.

When you think about it, our partnership was not supposed to happen. We are two guys from the opposite ends of the world, linked through a couple common friends and a desire to break free from the traditional office life. While we may be very uncommon in many ways, our passion for helping others and sharing the lessons we have learned along the way bonds us together. Though we each have chosen different routes in life and have arranged for different remote work situations, our diversity on this topic creates a stronger result.
