	Because we found quite some hurdles with starting to work remotely and got so much information on how to do this, we thought, why not share this with other people and help them work remote.
</p>

When you think about it, our partnership was not supposed to happen. Two guys from the opposite
ends of the world, linked through a couple common friends and a desire to break free from the
traditional office life. While we may be very uncommon in many ways, our passion for helping others
and sharing the lessons we have learned along the way bonds us together. Though we each have chosen
different routes in life and have arranged for different remote work situations, our diversity on this topic
creates a stronger result.

### About Michael

<p>
	<span class="image left"><img src="/images/michael-rogers.jpg" alt="Michael Rogers of Remote Movement"></span>
	Michael was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and had a strong desire to serve others. He also had a sense of adventure that took him around the world. After graduating from college, Michael spent ten years in the military, serving as a helicopter pilot and personnel officer. His career highlights include delivering supplies in Japan after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and effectively leading and mentoring hundreds of servicemembers throughout his career. After leaving the military, he returned to the Bay Area for a high paying job in Silicon Valley at a Fortune 500 company. He eventually got up the courage to ask for an extended remote work arrangement after months of being separated from his wife due to her job being in a different city. Over half a year has gone by and his performance evaluations are even better than before.

Michael loves the flexibility that remote work gives. He is able to travel while still keeping up with his corporate schedule. He is also able to devote time as the Executive Director of a non-profit that supports Navy and Marine Corps aviation, providing support to servicemembers and their families after aviation accidents and creating lasting memorials to honor their sacrifice.


### About Adriaan

<p>

	If there was a definition of ‘seizing the opportunity’, Adriaan would probably already be riding his motorbike there. Being the pragmatic optimist that he is, he feels that anything is possible - and why not do it right away? This action-oriented and sometimes cheeky attitude gets him into the craziest situations: from developing software for Member Get Member Company on a beach in Las Palmas to managing his own radio platform from a bar in Guatemala, only taking a quick break back home to develop a brand new app for Heineken.
</p>

Although following the warm weather is definitely a good reason to keep this nomad life going, it is not the main reason for his travelling urges. For Adriaan, life is about meeting new people with different mindsets, to keep the unexpected elements in his life and his career flowing. This international and fast-changing input gives him a unique and contagious development mindset, which he happily draws on while coaching new nomads.
