	<h2>Who</h2>
	<p>Because we found quite some hurdles with starting to work remotely and got so much information on how to do this, we thought, why not share this with other people and help them work remote.</p>

When you think about it, our partnership was not supposed to happen. Two guys from the opposite
ends of the world, linked through a couple common friends and a desire to break free from the
traditional office life. While we may be very uncommon in many ways, our passion for helping others
and sharing the lessons we have learned along the way bonds us together. Though we each have chosen
different routes in life and have arranged for different remote work situations, our diversity on this topic
creates a stronger result.

### About Michael
Michael was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and yearned for adventure and had a strong
desire to serve others. After graduating from college, Michael spent ten years in the military, serving as
a helicopter pilot and personnel officer. His career highlights include delivering supplies in Japan after
the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and effectively leading and mentoring hundreds of
servicemembers throughout his career. After leaving the military, he returned to the Bay Area for a high
paying job in Silicon Valley at a Fortune 500 company. He eventually got up the courage to ask for an
extended remote work arrangement after months of being separated from his wife due to her job being
in a different city. Over half a year has gone by and his performance evaluations are even better than
before.
