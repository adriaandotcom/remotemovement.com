	<h2>What is the remote movement?</h2>
</header>

As the world becomes more connected and the majority of office work required networked systems to collaborate, the necessity of being in the office to productively contribute is gone. At the same time, today’s knowledge worker’s continue to be in high demand and want a more flexible wife and life balance that will allow then to balance family life, travel, and emotional health while still working a traditional full time job. Working remotely has become a major workplace perk that employees can leverage for more production and satisfaction with their work-life balance. Employers will reap the benefits of employees who are more productive, loyal, and vested in the success of the organization of that has allowed them to flexibly contribute.

The Remote Movement hopes to bring about new discussions and advocacy for remote work. As knowledge workers around the world begin to realize their own remote work realities, we noticed that there is not much information about how to set up a remote work agreement with your manager, deal with the struggles unique to remote work, or work past some of the roadblocks that all remote workers face.

The movement or workers contributing remotely is here to stay and will be a driving factor in the future economy. The Remote Movement is the powerful platform where remote workers, or those who want to become remote, can learn how to powerfully achieve their goals and live the lives that they desire.
